# resnet50-cifar10-keras
Implementation of ResNet50 using Keras on CIFAR-10 Dataset

With 25 epoch on CIFAR-10 dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 75%. The same dataset achieved an accuracy  of 65% with Alexnet model.

Next target: Run till 200 epoch and publish the results for ResNet50.
Also run with ResNet150.
